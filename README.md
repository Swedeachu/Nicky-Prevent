<br>
When running the program a file called nicky.txt is made.
<br>
The first line of the text file is the key to block, and second line of text is the amount of debounce time in milliseconds.
<br>
By default:
<br>
W
<br>
50
<br>
Also this is called Nicky Prevent because my friend Nicky needed this for his broken keyboard's W key.
